# Matomo QuickExcludeVisitorIP Plugin

## Description

You want to ignore the visits of your colleagues with static IP addresses, but don't copy all of them manually?

This plugin adds a `ignore` button to the visitor log that immediately adds the IP Address of the visitor to the global Matomo IP ignore list.
